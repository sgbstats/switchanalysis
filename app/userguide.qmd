## User Guide

This tool was built to make interpreting switch analysis easier.

If you are a candidate, stop here and go and deliver some more leaflets and knock on more doors. This is for campaign managers and backroom staff. If you are unsure what switch analysis is, there is a guide on the next tab.

As with all switch analyses, a large amount of data is needed. You get the best results when you have several cycles of data but can still draw inferences in a start-up ward.



### Build your list

1.  Create a list on Connect

    -   Select people who have responded to a vote intent question in a period
    -   Make sure you have filtered by ward/constituency/etc
        -   It can cope with multiple wards
    -   You can pick a larger pool of people but you risk having a substantial number of people with no vote intent

2.  Run your list

3.  Click counts and then quick counts and cross tabs

Any target pool with Switch Analysis in its name, and a year will hold data frozen after the elections in that year. You can then run a report that compares the responses to your current voting intention question, or the Master Party ID, with how things were then. Usually we ensure that there is a switch analyse target pool that contains the MPID as it was immediately after the most recent general election, and another for the set of local elections four years ago. There are also usually two pools that freeze the canvass analysis as it was after the last election (whatever type of election happened most recently), both using the separate 37 canvass analysis categories and also summarised into each of the main parties.

### Build your Crosstabs

1.  In column 1, select your previous MPID by selecting the target pools option and picking the correct year

    -   There are several options you can choose from. If you had locals in 2025 then pick MPID 2025, if you have locals in 2024 then 2024, etc etc.
        -   These are in the target pools section

            ![](images/paste-9.png){width="250"}
    -   If you want to look at multiple wards, then choose ward in column 1 and you previous MPID in column 2

2.  In crosstab 1, choose master questions, vote intent, recent MPID

3.  Refresh results, export to excel, ignore warnings and save

### Running the analysis

1.  Load the file. The file can be the raw 'xls' file from Connect (that is actually an HTML file!!) or xlsx file that you have otherwise saved.

2.  This will load a familiar looking table, on the left is previous voter ID and across is the recent voter ID

3.  You can expand each row to reveal any subgroups

    ![](images/paste-3.png){width="300"}

4.  If there are multiple groups within your Recent MPID, then tick expand columns to show these (although it will collapse all rows that are already open).

5.  Tick the Show % box to express each row as a percentage.

    -   Each row will be relative to its own number in the denominator and so will the aggregate rows
    -   Be careful for small numbers in a row distorting percentages.

### Sankey Plot

#### The theory

A sankey plot will show the flow between two sets of states. The wider the path the more people.

What we need to be careful of here is that there may be different numbers of people in each group which could distort the size of the bar.

Without adding assumptions, you could be at risk making wrong interpretation.

#### How to use

When you open the Sankey Plot tab, you will see the assumptions menu.

In here you can add weights to the bars so that the left side is proportion to your own circumstances.

This defaults to equal weights so you can see how each party is breaking (but remember there may be distortions due to small numbers).

Currently, I would suggest using your previous election results and then in new voters, add the turnover in your ward.

While no data includes, latent voters (those that have voted before but don't have any data) and new data. It is yet to be found whether these different groups of breakdown differently.

Use the Show % box to show the percentage of each column relative to the total in that column. Remember if you are using some of the no data categories, this will distort the percentages from what you enter.

Obviously, if you are starting from further back you are going to need to switch more voters than if it is very close or you won previously.

The Sankey diagram can be slow to update.

This may be indicative of a prediction but currently is not valid as one.

You can untick the weighted diagram box but this will distort the data.

#### Crosstabs

If you have an analysis that has extra crosstabs, it will give you the option here to split by each the different options in the first cross tab.
